## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
    1. The tour table was too large to have all of the information displayed on mobile devices
    
        *Solutions:* a css property of overflow-x: auto; was added to the container housing the table. I learned about this fix from a stack overflow question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471210/handling-overflow-in-tables)

    2. The submit button on the contact form does not observe the spacing from the form that was shown on all other browsers tested
    
        *Solutions:* I added a firefox only CSS rule following the guidance in this thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952861/targeting-only-firefox-with-css).

        This solution generated a warning in the CSS validator that the moz-appearance query is a vendor extension, but it still passed the validator with no errors.

    3. My text area box on the form was able to manipulated by the user, so I had to fix this so it was not expandable or contractable.

        *Solutions:* a css property of resize: none was added to text area element

+ ### Unsolved bugs
    - None
+ ### Mistakes
    - I used past simple tense in commit messages due to the habit when I just started working on this project.
    - While progressing in my code I learned to use present simple tense in commit messages.
    - I did not write the styles with mobile as the primary viewing method, but I styled with desktop first and had to implement media queries for smaller devices. If I was doing the project over again I would write the smalled device query styles as the main section of the CSS file, and have media queries only for changes to accommodate larger devices.
