# Jigsawtiger

Jigsawtiger is a website for (my friend) the Glasgow music producer, singer and DJ, Jigsawtiger. This site is a rework of an existing website for the artist, which can be viewed via this link (https://www.jigsawtiger.com/). My version of her site uses some of the same assets but aims to present them in a responsive way for all devices, and with a colour-scheme which is better for accessibility. The site aims to give information about Jigsawtiger to three distinct groups of users:

 - People who have just discovered Jigsawtiger and want to hear more of her music or find out more about her
 - Long-term fans of Jigsawtiger who want to quickly find her latest releases or DJ sets, and see when she is touring
 - Music promoters who would like to have a convenient way to get in touch with Jigsawtiger about booking her for a show.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/color_pallet.png)

- Soft blue color was used as the main color of the website due to its phycological effect on people's minds. As this color is associated with trustworthiness and reliability, website visitors could build a firm believe in the organization "Animal Shelter".

- Light Blue Color was used as a background color since this color creates a sense of tranquility and makes a connection between animal's ownership and peacefulness.

- Purple color was used to make an emphasis on the logo and leave a memorable effect on the website visitors.

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/primary_font.png)

- Lato Google Font was used as the main font of the website in order to increase readability of the content on the pages.

![Accent Font](documentation/accent_font.png)

- Lobster Google Font was used to attract viewers' attention to the company's logo, to make an accent on the strong points of the company, and to incentivize visitors to contact "Animal Shelter".



### Features Left to Implement

- Fully functioning contact form which directs enquiries to an SQL database and generates email notifications

## Credits 

I took inspiration for the styles in the header section from the love running tutorial, but adapted the code for my project rather than copying it in completely.

My mentor Julia Konovalova gave lots of useful advice during my project, especially to make the nav section positioned absolutely so it always shows no matter how far the user scrolls down the page. She also helped me amend my original 2-column layout that I had planned during the wireframe phase of the project.

### Content 

- I used the website [Favicon generator] https://favicon.io/ to generate the logo and favicon for the site
- The text for the homepage and music page of the site were taken directly from the [original Jigsawtiger website](https://www.jigsawtiger.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media
